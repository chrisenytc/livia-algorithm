The Livia algorithm is a complex mathematical where your goal is to find the constant value of Livia and use as a value for use in the resolution of logical equation.

## Algorithm Expression

The Livia algorithm is represented by the expression:

```
L = 198 . 23¹⁰   
    ———   ———
     B    27
     ———————
      LIV¹⁴
      ————
       ∞ 
```

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install livia-algorithm`

```javascript
var livia = require('livia-algorithm');

livia.algorithm(19); // 1536469790810033
```

## Examples

#### .algorithm(infinite)
Using Algorithm with Infinite Variable

```javascript
var livia = require('livia-algorithm');

livia.algorithm(19); // 1536469790810033
```

#### .random()
Using Random Algorithm

```javascript
var livia = require('livia-algorithm');

livia.random(); // Random number
```
